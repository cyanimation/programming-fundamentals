You will die
You will be a millionaire
You will adopt 50 kids
You fall in love with a tall dark stranger
You are getting a promotion
Pack your bags because you are moving
Soon financial success will come
You will live
Help I'm stuck in a computer program!
You will get lost in Alaska
You will get eaten by a bear
Death is knocking at your door
You will start the zombie apocolypse
You will meet your childhood hero
Don't eat the fish
Turn around. Your dog is looking at you
Boo!
The answer to life is 42
Don't divide by zero you might create an explosion
Eat a cookie
You're going to be old an angry
A misile is heading your way because a beginner programmer launched one.
