# Lesson 1 Homework

This weeks homework consists of two programs and some practice questions.

1. Tip Calculator
2. GPA Calculator (optional)
3. Practice Questions

My suggestions to you of how to create these programs can be found in
tip_calculator.py and gpa_calculator.py. These contain the basic
[algorithms](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/algorithm) I would follow
if I were creating these programs.

I have provided a sample program (basics.py) to provide you a template of how
your program should be. You are free to copy portions of my code to use in your
program but I highly encourage you to fully understand what it is doing before
doing so.

You may email me your program when you finish and I can annotate it (put
comments on it) and then email you my annotated program if you would like more
detailed suggestions or analysis. You may also email me your practice
questions or simply turn them in on Wednesday.

Please contact me if you have any concerns surrounding this homework. I want you
to be able to succeed.
