Programming is one of the most rewarding activities you could become engaged in.
It is one of the best things I have ever learned and I think that learning to
program is for everyone. Before we dive in and discuss what this course is all
about I want to encourage you to watch a video that I really enjoy.

## Getting Started

### My Model

This course will not have a scheduled class time where I lecture and you listen.
Instead, I have prepared a number of videos and documents for you to watch and
read. These will take the place of lectures and should teach you everything you
need to know to complete the homework assignments.

I understand that everyone learns differently so I apologize if this model isn't
your preferred method of learning. My reason for this model is that I want
people to be able to learn at their own pace and not feel left behind if they
miss class or held back if they are hungry for more.

I still want to have some face time with the students so I will be making myself
available on a weekly basis for anyone to come and ask me questions in person.


### Our Environment

We are going to learn to program using the [Python
language](https://www.python.org/).  There are different environments that you
can use to program in but we are going to use a
[cloud](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32016/what-is-cloud-computing-and-what-does-this-stupid-buzzword-mean/)
environment called Koding. You will need to create a free account on Koding so
that you will have an environment to program in. Go ahead and click the link
below to sign up.

**_[Sign up for Koding](https://koding.com/)_**

This course will have a number of videos and I will be using Koding as my
programming environment. So unless you feel really comfortable using something
different than what we will all be using in class, I would encourage you to use
Koding.

### Our Book

This is a stand-alone course and you will not need to read a book to learn the
material but I know that many people learn better from reading. I have,
therefore, provided a book that I think is extensive and appropriate for the
topics we will learning. The book is free and has an online copy. Check it out
at the link below.

**_[A Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/)_**

I will provide links to appropriate portions of the text as they apply. You may
read them if you wish. It is often nice to learn from multiple sources so I
encourage you to do so but it is not required.
