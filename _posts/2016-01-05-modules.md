Modules are very useful to use in our programs. They are pieces of code that
someone else wrote (they could even be your own modules) that you can import
into your program. They have functions on them that you can call to perform
something special.

### Examples

Some common modules are `sys`, `os`, `math` and `random`. These are really handy and one
of my favorites is `random`. We could create a little dice rolling program using
`random`:

{% highlight python %}
import random
print random.randint(1,6)
{% endhighlight %}
    
This very simple program will print out a random number between 1 and 6.

You can import modules in various ways:

- `import random` will simply import all of random's functions prefixed by
  random as we saw in the example above.  - 
- `import random as rand` will allow you to shorten the command like: 
  `print rand.randint(1,6)`
- `from random import randint` will allow you to call `randint` without any
  prefix: `print randint(1,6)`
- `from random import *` will import all of randoms methods in a manner that you
  don't have to prefix them (I don't recommend doing this)
